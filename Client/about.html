GOGITiT was created as a group thesis project at Telegraph Academy. Seeing that github had no identifiers itself to give users information on what frameworks are being used based on popularity, the goal was to find a way to retrieve and display this data by order of frequency. 

To achieve this goal we used Google's Big Query to retrieve daily activity from Github's API for all javascript repos. By parsing through the package.json and index.html files of each repo we were able to keep individual records of the frameworks being used and keep a cumulative count of the occurences that we would display using a series of D3 data visualization graphs.
